Stripe Integration
Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table (done)

Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token

Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app 
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note which plan.

Once validated, rails should send uers info (email, plan id) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back
customer token.

Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
